# Bike Sharing 

## Purpose:
The purpose of the bikesharing project is to analyze bike usage in NYC to consider replicabiltiy and sustainability of the business in Des Moines, Iowa.

##  Results:
The results of the analysis show that bike sharing through subscription is a common practice for people in NYC. Males are among the highest users of the program and often use bikes in short trips on weekdays most often during start and end of workday hours. 


The visuals below provide a series of graphs that show the results indicated above.

The chart below suggests that bike returns occur at the same stations to where they were initially rented. This may be a result of renters using bikes stations located in their neighborhoods.

## Summary: 
Reviewing the data provided above one might conclude that bicycles are a popular mode of transportation to get to and from work. In urban areas where parking is difficult to find and castly, bicycles are likely a more economical form of transporation. Bicycles would make it easier to navigate the city for short trip durations and be easier to store throughout the day. Along with being economical, bicycles provide some the added bonus of a bit of exercise getting to and from work! 

Considering the scope of the project, bike sharing may be a viable business in urban areas, such as Des Moines, during the work week and marketed as such could provide a sustainable business model.
