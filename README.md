## Summary: 
Reviewing the data provided above one might conclude that bicycles are a popular mode of transportation to get to and from work. In urban areas where parking is difficult to find and castly, bicycles are likely a more economical form of transporation. Bicycles would make it easier to navigate the city for short trip durations and be easier to store throughout the day. Along with being economical, bicycles provide some the added bonus of a bit of exercise getting to and from work! 

Considering the scope of the project, bike sharing may be a viable business in urban areas, such as Des Moines, during the work week and marketed as such could provide a sustainable business model.
